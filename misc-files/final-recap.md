## Final Exam Recap

The final exam is cumulative.
The list below gives a highlight of some
of the main topics and some information on what you would be
expected to do.  This list is not all inclusive (e.g. there may
be something on the exam not on this list, but covered in class),
though there is nothing intentionally left out.

**Note:** I understand and recognize that some of this
stuff you might be able to test by retyping code and running.
While that's a useful tool to check, if you have to do it for everything
there is a decent chance you might run out of time on the tests / not
have enough time to do the questions that actually ask you to write code.

## General Big Picture Tasks
* **KNOW TO USE AND BE ABLE TO ACCESS AND READ THE MANPAGES**
* Make sure you know how to access files you edit in the terminal
  (this is particularly for Windows subsytem users to make sure you
  know how to upload your code files to PL)
* Make sure you can move files to/from EOS in case you need to
  (whether this is to enter the command to do so on the linux portion
  or in case you need to use `gdb` or `valgrind` on the C portion).
* Be comfortable editing files with vim (e.g. C code, gawk script, bash script, etc)



## C Portion

### Big Picture Tasks
* Be able to write C, compile and run C code using loops,
  structs, pointers, dynamic memory allocation,
  arrays, accepting input, printing output, etc. (Note -- I won't
  ask you to write from scratch any code as complicated as the 4th
  project).
* Be able to look at C code and understand
  * what it does
  * what its output would be
  * whether it has issues (e.g. memory leaks,
    use of uninitialized values,
    other undefined behavior,
    accessing memory it does not have the right to access,
    etc.)
* Be able to identify the correct C code to accomplish a specific task
* Be able to identify issues and fix C code that isn't working

      to something other than stdout,
      but you should be able to answer a simple checkbox / multiple
      choice / matching type question about it

      but you should be able to answer a simple checkbox / multiple
      choice / matching type question about them
* String and memory functions
    * Have some idea of what they do (or know how to figure it out)
    * I won't ask you to write code that requires you to use these,
      but you should be able to answer a simple checkbox / multiple
      choice / matching type question about them
